Hello everyone,

When I first found out I would participate, I felt a mix of great joy and emotions that are hard to explain—a combination of pride, excitement, and a little nervousness.
The trip itself was exhausting but very exciting, and even better than I expected my favourite part was the visit to the flight deck.
The reception at the school was wonderful. I felt very welcomed, especially by my head chair, the head secretary and co-chairs.
The moments that marked me the most were the school reception, taking part in the activities and debates, and connecting with new friends. Returning to Faro airport was also very emotional—a moment filled with pride.
Thank you.
