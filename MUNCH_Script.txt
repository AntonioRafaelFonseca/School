Hello everyone,

I’m very excited to share my experience at MUNCH. When I first found out I would participate, I felt a mix of great joy and emotions that are hard to explain—a combination of pride, excitement, and a little nervousness.
Preparing for the event was more challenging than I expected. The amount of work, managing my time, and the complexity of the topics made it difficult. The support I received was good, but it could have been done differently. I especially think the rehearsals could have reflected more closely what we would actually do, instead of just reading my solutions to my colleagues.
The trip itself was exhausting but very exciting, and even better than I expected. During the journey, I felt enthusiastic, a little nervous, and confident at the same time.
The reception at the school was wonderful. I felt very welcomed, especially by my head chair, the head secretary and co-chairs. The environment was warm, organized, and immediately made me feel part of the experience.
Participating in the activities was very engaging, and even though speaking English was a bit nerve-wracking, it was a positive and enriching experience. I also made some very special friendships that truly marked this journey. The people who stood out to me the most were Alan and Rody, the head secretary.
The moments that marked me the most were the school reception, taking part in the activities and debates, and connecting with new friends. Returning to Faro airport was also very emotional—a moment filled with pride.
Overall, I would describe my MUNCH experience as a unique opportunity to live something new and exciting. It was challenging, inspiring, and unforgettable.
Thank you.
